title: Vercel

Rakkas projects can be deployed to [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions) or [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions). For Vercel-edge, you should install the suitable HatTip adapter first:

```bash
npm install -S @hattip/vercel-edge
```

Serverless functions don't require any additional packages. Then you should set the `adapter` option of Rakkas Vite plugin to `"vercel"` or `"vercel-edge"`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import rakkas from "rakkasjs/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    rakkas({
      adapter: "vercel", // or "vercel-edge"
    }),
  ],
});
```

After building with `rakkas build`, you can deploy with `vercel deploy --prebuilt`.

## Worker-specific APIs

Vercel Edge Functions run on a worker runtime. But, during development, Rakkas applications always run on Node.js regardless of the `adapter` setting. As such, Worker APIs will not be available during development. We're looking into ways of polyfilling these APIs for development. Also, `process.env` is not yet available for Vercel Edge.
