Integrating a non-trivial tool or library into a Rakkas app usually entails some of the following:

- Adding Vite plugins or tweaking Vite configuration options. Rakkas respects the settings in the `vite.config.js` (or `.ts`) file.
- Tweaking various aspects of the app using the [client](client-entry), [server](hattip-entry), and [common](common-hooks) customization hooks.
