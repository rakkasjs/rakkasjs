title: Deno

Rakkas projects can be built to run on [Deno](https://deno.land/) and can be deployed to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). First, you should install the suitable HatTip adapter:

```bash
npm install -S @hattip/adapter-deno
```

Then you should set the `adapter` option of Rakkas Vite plugin to `"deno"`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import rakkas from "rakkasjs/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    rakkas({
      adapter: "deno",
    }),
  ],
});
```

After building with `rakkas build`, you can run with `deno run --allow-read --allow-net --allow-env dist/deno/index.js` or deploy with `cd dist/deno && deployctl deploy --token <TOKEN> --project=<PROJECT> index.js` (replace `<TOKEN>` and `<PROJECT>` with your own).

## Deno-specific APIs

During development, Rakkas applications always run on Node.js regardless of the `adapter` setting. As such, Deno APIs will not be available during development. We're looking into ways of polyfilling these APIs for development.
