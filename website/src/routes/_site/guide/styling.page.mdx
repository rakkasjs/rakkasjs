title: Styling

Rakkas allows you to use all styling options available to React apps.

Importing a `.css` file will inject its content to the page via a `<style>` tag. During development, it will happen dynamically so you may see a flash of unstyled content. When you build your app for production, though, imported styles will be split into external `.css` files and everything will work even with JavaScript disabled.

For component scoped styles, Rakkas supports [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) with the usual naming convention `.module.css`.

If the project contains a valid PostCSS config, it will be automatically applied to all imported CSS. **CSS preprocessors** are also supported out of the box: You just need to install your preferred processor (`sass`, `less`, or `stylus`) to enable support for `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less`, `.styl` and `.stylus` file extensions. See [Vite's documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for further details.

Rakkas also allows you to use **CSS-in-JS solutions**. See, for example, the [Emotion example](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkasjs/tree/main/examples/emotion). Please bear in mind that CSS-in-JS solutions may have [implementation and performance issues when performing streaming SSR](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/110).
