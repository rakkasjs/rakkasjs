title: Bun
---

Rakkas projects can be built to run on [Bun](https://bun.sh). First, you should install the suitable HatTip adapter:

```bash
npm install -S @hattip/adapter-bun
```

Then you should set the `adapter` option of Rakkas Vite plugin to `"bun"`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import rakkas from "rakkasjs/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    rakkas({
      adapter: "bun",
    }),
  ],
});
```

After building with `rakkas build`, you can run your project with `bun run dist/server/entry-bun.js`.

## Limitations

- Bun doesn't support streaming, so streaming is disabled.
- Bun doesn't have a `Request.prototype.formData()` implementation yet. Rakkas polyfills it using `URLSearchParams` so only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is supported. `multipart/form-data` is not supported.
