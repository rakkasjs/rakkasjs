# Fast refresh

Fast Refresh is a React feature that allows you to get immediate feedback for changes in your React components. If you edit a file that **only exports React components**, Fast Refresh will update the code only for that file, and re-render your component.

> ⚠️ You should not export any _value_ other than your page or layout component from page and layout source files. Exporting _types_ is OK.

Fast Refresh doesn't preserve state for class components.
