title: Route guards
---

Sometimes you want some of your pages to be available only under certain conditions. Use cases include:

- Restrict access to a page to authenticated users only
- Make some pages only available during development
- Make some pages only available to certain subdomains (e.g. in multi-tenant applications)

Rakkas's solution to such requirements is called route guards. A route guard is a file named `*.guard.js` (or `*.guard.ts`) that is placed next to the `*.page.jsx` (or `*.page.tsx`) file. It's expected to export a `pageGuard` function. It can:

- Return `false` to prevent the page from rendering.
- Return `{ redirect: "/some/url" }` to redirect.
- Return `{ rewrite: "/new/url" }` to render as if the URL was `/new/url`.
- Return true to continue as normal.

The rewrite feature is handy, for example, to redirect to a login form while remembering the original URL.

A route guard can also guard all pages under a directory if it's named `$guard.js` (or `.ts`). Guards are called starting from the outermost one. All have to return true for the page to render.

## Disabling catch-all page routes <a id="catch-all" />

Another use case for route guards is to disable catch-all page routes that shadow API routes. For example, `/foo/[...slug].page.tsx` will match `/foo/bar` before an API route `/foo/bar.api.ts` is matched, effectively shadowing it. To prevent this, you can create a guard file `foo/[...slug].guard.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import type { LookupHookResult, PageContext } from "rakkasjs";

export function pageGuard(ctx: PageContext): LookupHookResult {
  // Selectively disable the catch-all page route for /foo/bar
  return ctx.url.pathname !== "/foo/bar";
}
```
