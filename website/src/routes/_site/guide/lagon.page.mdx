title: Lagon
---

Rakkas projects can be built to run on [Lagon](https://lagon.app/), an upcoming JavaScript runtime for the edge. First, you should install the suitable HatTip adapter:

```bash
npm install -S @hattip/adapter-lagon
```

Then you should set the `adapter` option of Rakkas Vite plugin to `"lagon"`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import rakkas from "rakkasjs/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    rakkas({
      adapter: "lagon",
    }),
  ],
});
```

After building with `rakkas build`, you can run your project with `lagon dev dist/server/entry-lagon.js --public-dir dist/client`.

## Limitations

Lagon is in early development, so it is not ready for production use yet.
