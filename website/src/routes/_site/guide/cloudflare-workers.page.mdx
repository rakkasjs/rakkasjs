title: Cloudflare Workers
---

Rakkas projects can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers. First, you should install the suitable HatTip adapter:

```bash
npm install -S @hattip/adapter-cloudflare-workers
```

Then you should set the `adapter` option of Rakkas Vite plugin to `"cloudflare-workers"`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import rakkas from "rakkasjs/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		rakkas({
			adapter: "cloudflare-workers",
		}),
	],
});
```

Then create a `wrangler.toml` file like this:

```toml
name = "my-rakkas-project"
compatibility_date = "2021-11-01"
compatibility_flags = [
  "streams_enable_constructors",
]
main = "dist/server/cloudflare-workers-bundle.js"
usage_model = 'bundled'
workers_dev = true

[site]
bucket = "./dist/client"
```

After building with `rakkas build`, you can publish your project with `wrangler publish`. You can also test locally with `wrangler dev --local`.

## Cloudflare Workers-specific APIs

During development, Rakkas applications always run on Node.js regardless of the `adapter` setting. As such, Cloudflare Workers-specific APIs like the KV store and durable objects are not available. You can polyfill them using, e.g., [`@miniflare/kv`](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/tree/master/packages/kv) and [@miniflare/durable-objects](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/tree/master/packages/durable-objects) packages in a [custom Node.js entry](node#custom-entry).
