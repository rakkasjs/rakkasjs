## Importing asset URLs

You can obtain the runtime public URL of a static asset by simply importing it:

```js
import imgUrl from "./img.png";

function MyImage() {
	return <img src={imgUrl} />;
}
```

For example, `imgUrl` will be `/src/img.png` during development, and become `/assets/img.2d8efhg.png` in the production build.

Import can be either using absolute public paths (based on project root during dev) or relative paths.

- `url()` references in CSS are handled the same way.
- Common image, media, and font filetypes are detected as assets automatically. You can extend the internal list using Vite's [`assetsInclude` option](/config/#assetsinclude).
- Referenced assets are included as part of the build assets graph, will get hashed file names, and can be processed by Vite plugins for optimization.
- Assets smaller in bytes than the [`assetsInlineLimit` option](/config/#build-assetsinlinelimit) will be inlined as base64 data URLs.
- Assets that are not included in the internal list or in `assetsInclude`, can be explicitly imported as an URL using the `?url` suffix.

### Importing asset contents

Assets can be imported as strings using the `?raw` suffix.

```js
import shaderString from "./shader.glsl?raw";
```

## The `public` Directory <a id="public-directory" />

If you have assets that are:

- Never referenced in source code (e.g. `robots.txt`)
- Must retain the exact same file name (without hashing)
- ...or you simply don't want to have to import an asset first just to get its URL

Then you can place the asset in the `public` directory under your project root. Assets in this directory will be served at root path `/` during dev, and copied to the root of the dist directory as-is.

Note that:

- You should always reference `public` assets using root absolute path - for example, `public/icon.png` should be referenced in source code as `/icon.png`.
- Assets in `public` cannot be imported from JavaScript.
