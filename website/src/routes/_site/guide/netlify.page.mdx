> Netlify Edge Functions is currently an experimental technology.

Rakkas projects can be deployed to [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) or [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/). First, you should install the suitable HatTip adapter:

```bash
npm install -S @hattip/adapter-netlify # or @hattip/adapter-netlify-edge
```

Then you should set the `adapter` option of Rakkas Vite plugin to `"netlify"` or `"netlify-edge"`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import rakkas from "rakkasjs/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    rakkas({
      adapter: "netlify", // or "netlify-edge"
    }),
  ],
});
```

Then create a `netlify.toml` file like this:

```toml
[build]
publish = "netlify/static"

[dev]
framework = "#static"

# Uncomment for Netlify Edge
# [[edge_functions]]
# function = "edge"
# path = "/*"
```

After building with `rakkas build`, you can preview your app with `netlify dev` or publish with `netlify deploy`.

## Deno-specific APIs

Netlify Edge Functions run on a Deno runtime. But, during development, Rakkas applications always run on Node.js regardless of the `adapter` setting. As such, Deno APIs will not be available during development. We're looking into ways of polyfilling these APIs for development.
