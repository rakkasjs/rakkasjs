title: API middleware
---

If you create a file named `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts` in the `src/routes` directory or one of its subdirectories, it will become a **middleware** for API routes in that directory or its subdirectories. Middleware modules default export a middleware function that takes a HatTip RequestContext. It can either return a response or `undefined` to pass the request to the next middleware or API handler. It can also call `await context.next()` to call the next handler to be able to modify the response.

```ts
import { RequestContext } from "rakkasjs";
import { Session, getSession } from "./session";

declare module "rakkasjs" {
	// Redefine to provide types for ctx.locals
	interface ServerSideLocals {
		session: Session;
	}
}

export default async function sessionMiddleware(ctx: RequestContext) {
	ctx.locals.session = await getSession(ctx);
	// The session will be available as ctx.locals in subsequent handlers
}
```
