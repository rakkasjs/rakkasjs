title: Refetching
---

`useQuery` and `useServerSideQuery` return a `QueryResult` object. Apart from the `data` property, it also has a `refetch` method that can be used to refetch the data on demand:

<CodeViewer
	name="guide-samples"
	openFiles={["src/routes/refetch/index.page.tsx"]}
	url="/refetch"
/>

`useQuery` and `useServerSideQuery` takes an options argument that controls how and when to cache a query and when to refetch automatically:

```ts
export interface UseQueryOptions {
	/**
	 * Time in milliseconds after which the value will be evicted from the
	 * cache when there are no subscribers. Use 0 for immediate eviction and
	 * `Infinity` to disable.
	 *
	 * @default 300_000 (5 minutes)
	 */
	cacheTime?: number;
	/**
	 * Time in milliseconds after which a cached value will be considered
	 * stale.
	 *
	 * @default 100
	 */
	staleTime?: number;
	/**
	 * Refetch the query when the component is mounted. If set to `true`, a stale
	 * query will be refetched when the component is mounted. If set to `"always"`,
	 * the query will be refetched when the component is mounted regardless of
	 * staleness. `false` disables this behavior.
	 *
	 * @default true
	 */
	refetchOnMount?: boolean | "always";
	/**
	 * Refetch the query when the window gains focus. If set to `true`, the
	 * query will be refetched on window focus if it is stale. If set to
	 * `"always"`, the query will be refetched on window focus regardless of
	 * staleness. `false` disables this behavior.
	 *
	 * @default false
	 */
	refetchOnWindowFocus?: boolean | "always";
	/**
	 * Continuously refetch every `refetchInterval` milliseconds. Set to false
	 * to disable.
	 *
	 * @default false
	 */
	refetchInterval?: number | false;
	/**
	 * Perform continuous refetching even when the window is in the background.
	 *
	 * @default false
	 */
	refetchIntervalInBackground?: boolean;
	/**
	 * Refetch the query when the internet connection is restored. If set to
	 * `true`, a stale query will be refetched when the internet connection is
	 * restored. If set to `"always"`, the query will be refetched when the
	 * internet connection is restored regardless of staleness. `false` disables
	 * this behavior.
	 *
	 * @default false
	 */
	refetchOnReconnect?: boolean | "always";
}
