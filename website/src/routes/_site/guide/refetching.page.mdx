# Refetching

`useQuery` and `useServerSideQuery` return a `QueryResult` object. Apart from the `data` property, it also has a `refetch` method that can be used to refetch the data on demand:

import refetchExample from "$examples/refetch/index.page.tsx?sample";

<SampleViewer url="/examples/refetch" code={refetchExample} />

- When a page or layout is being rendered on the server side.
- When client-side navigation causes a page or layout change. Only the `load` functions of the page component and those of the newly mounted layout components will be called. If a layout is shared between the previous and next page, it will stay mounted and won't be reloaded.
- _Only for pages:_ When the URL path or query string (`url.pathname` and `url.search`) changes. Layouts are not affected.
- _Only during development:_ When a page or layout module is hot reloaded.
- When the [locale](/guide/localized-routes) changes.

There are three methods for changing the reloading behavior:

## `getCacheKey` function

You can have a `getCacheKey` function in the object you pass to `definePage` or `defineLayout`. It is passed the same arguments as the `load` function except for `fetch`. Its return value can be anything that can be serialized into JSON. Rakkas will call it every time it has to decide whether to call the `load` function and will only call it if the return value is different than the last time.

For example, you can tell Rakkas to call a page's `load` function only when the URL path changes and not when the query string changes:

-- SAMPLE --

{/\*
import getCacheKeyPage from "$examples/get-cache-key/page.tsx?sample";

<SampleViewer code={getCacheKeyPage} />

Or you can force Rakkas to call your layout's `load` function when the URL path changes:

import getCacheKeyLayout from "$examples/get-cache-key/layout.tsx?sample";

<SampleViewer code={getCacheKeyLayout} />
*/}

## `reload` function

Page and layout components are passed a `reload` prop which you can use to manually force Rakkas to call its `load` function and rerender it:

## `useReload` custom hook

Page and layout components are passed a `useReload` function which is a React custom hook used to force a reload under certain conditions:

-- SAMPLE --

{/\*
\*/}

## Static site generation

`reload` and `useReload` are no-ops on a statically exported page since its data is supposed to be static anyway.
