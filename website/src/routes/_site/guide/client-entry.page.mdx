title: Client entry
---

The main client-side entry point of a Rakkas application is the `src/entry-client.js` (or `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`) file. Rakkas has a default implementation, so you don't have to provide one. But it exposes advanced customization features that you might find useful. This file should call `startClient` the function to start the client.

```tsx
import { startClient } from "rakkasjs";

startClient({
	hooks: {
		beforeStart() {
			// Do something before starting the client
		},
		extendPageContext(ctx) {
			// Add properties to the page context,
			// especially to ctx.locals.
			// Extensions added here will only be
			// available on the client-side.
		},
		wrapApp(app) {
			// Wrap the Rakkas application in some provider
			// component (only on the client).
			return <SomeProvider>{app}</SomeProvider>;
		},
	},
	defaultQueryOptions: {
		// Global defaults for `useQuery` options
	},
});
```
