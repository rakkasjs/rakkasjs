title: Client entry
---

The main client-side entry point of a Rakkas application is the `src/entry-client.js` (or `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`) file. Rakkas has a default implementation, so you don't have to provide one. But it exposes advanced customization features that you might find useful. If provided, it should call the `startClient` function to start the client.

```tsx
import { startClient } from "rakkasjs";

startClient({
  hooks: {
    beforeStart() {
      // Do something before starting the client
    },
    extendPageContext(ctx) {
      // Add properties to the page context,
      // especially to ctx.locals.
      // Extensions added here will only be
      // available on the client-side.
    },
    wrapApp(app) {
      // Wrap the Rakkas application in some provider
      // component (only on the client).
      return <SomeProvider>{app}</SomeProvider>;
    },
  },
  defaultQueryOptions: {
    // Global defaults for `useQuery` options
  },
});
```
