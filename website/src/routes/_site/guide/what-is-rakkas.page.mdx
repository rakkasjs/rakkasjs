# What is Rakkas?

**Rakkas** is a full-stack web framework powered by [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). It aims to provide a developer experience which we deem superior in some regards to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Remix](https://remix.run/), or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Important features are:

- ⚡&nbsp; Lightning fast development server
- 🖥️&nbsp; Streaming server-side rendering
- 🔀&nbsp; Dynamic rendering (full static pages for bots, streaming for browsers)
- ⬇️&nbsp; Easiest data fetching system among React frameworks
- 🚀&nbsp; Support for deployment on serverless and worker environments
- 📄&nbsp; Static site generation
- 🇺🇳&nbsp; Localizable URLs
- ☸️&nbsp; Optional SPA-style client-side navigation
- 📁&nbsp; Intuitive file system-based routing
- ⚙️&nbsp; API routes and middleware

See the [feature comparison with Next.js](/guide/feature-comparison) for other supported and planned features.

## Is Rakkas right for you?

- Although many features have been implemented, Rakkas is still under heavy development. It uses **experimental and/or beta features** of React and Vite. There _will_ be breaking changes until we hit 1.0. As such, it's **not yet ready for production use**. If you need a stable React framework try Next.js, Remix, or Gatsby.
- Rakkas is somewhat opinionated. If you need more flexibility try [vite-ssr-plugin](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/).
