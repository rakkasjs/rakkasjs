title: Node.js

Node.js is the default deployment target for Rakkas. After building your application with `rakkas build`, you can run it with `node dist/server/index.js`.

## Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to configure the runtime behavior of a Rakkas application:

### `HOST`

The hostname to bind the server to. Defaults to `localhost`.

### `PORT`

The port to bind the server to. Defaults to `3000`.

### `TRUST_PROXY`

Whether to trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers. If set to `1`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` are used to determine the origin when `ORIGIN` is not set. `X-Forwarded-For` is used to determine the IP address. The leftmost value is used if multiple values are set.

### `ORIGIN`

Set the URL origin, e.g. `https://example.com`. If not set, the origin will be computed from the protocol and hostname. To determine the protocol, `req.protocol` is tried first. If `TRUST_PROXY` is set, `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is used. Otherwise, `req.socket.encrypted` is used. To determine the hostname, `X-Forwarded-Host` (if `TRUST_PROXY` is set) or `Host` header is used.

## Custom entry

To define a custom Node.js entry point, you must first provide a [HatTip entry](hattip-entry). Then you can create a `src/entry-node.js` (or `.ts`) file that exports a Node (`(req, res) => {}`) request handler function. A minimal custom Node.js entry would look like this:

```js
import { createMiddleware } from "rakkasjs/node-adapter";
import hattipHandler from "./entry-hattip";

export default createMiddleware(hattipHandler);
```

A custom Node.js entry makes it possible to integrate Rakkas with Express and other Node.js frameworks:

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "rakkasjs/node-adapter";
import hattipHandler from "./entry-hattip";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// You can use Express routes and middleware here
app.get("/express", (req, res) => {
	res.json({ message: "Hello from express!" });
});

app.use(createMiddleware(hattipHandler));

// An Express app is actually a request handler function
export default app;
```
