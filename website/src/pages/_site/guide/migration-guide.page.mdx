# Migration guide

## 0.4 to 0.5

- Remove the `@rakkasjs/runner-node` package.
- Upgrade to `rakkasjs@0.5.0` and `@rakkasjs/cli@0.5.0`.
- Update your `start` script to `node dist/server` instead of `@rakkasjs/runner-node`.
- If you were using `rakkas export` to generate a static site:
  - Change your build command to `rakkas build -d static`.
  - Serve your static site from `dist` instead of `dist/static`.
  - `load` functions in static sites will now run like in normal sites instead of caching their results. If you're relying on a slow or ever-changing external API, create internal API endpoints accessed with `GET` method do the downstream fetching there since `GET` API endpoints can now be prerendered.
- `NavLink` is deprecated, use `StyledLink` instead.
- Rename `NavLink`'s props as follows:
  - `currentRouteClass` as `activeClass`
  - `currentRouteStyle` as `activeStyle`
  - `nextRouteClass` as `pendingClass`
  - `nextRouteStyle` as `pendingStyle`
- Rename `useRouter`'s return value's properties, `current` is now `currentUrl` and `next` is now `pendingUrl`.
- Return `redirect` instead of `location` to redirect from your `load` functions.
