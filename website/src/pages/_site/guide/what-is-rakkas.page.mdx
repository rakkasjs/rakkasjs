# What is Rakkas?

**Rakkas** is a web framework powered by [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) that aims to have a developer experience similar to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Many of its features are also inspired by [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev). Important features are:

- ⚡&nbsp; Lightning fast development
- 🖥️&nbsp; Hassle free server-side rendering
- 🚀&nbsp; Support for deploying on serverless environments
- 📄&nbsp; Static site generation
- 🔀&nbsp; Rendering modes (pre-rendering, server-side, client-side)
- ☸️&nbsp; SPA-style client-side navigation
- 📁&nbsp; Intuitive file system-based routing
- ⬇️&nbsp; Simple but effective data fetching system
- ⚙️&nbsp; API routes to build and organize your backend

See the [feature comparison page with Next.js](/guide/feature-comparison) for other supported and planned features.

## Is Rakkas right for you?

- Although many features have been implemented, Rakkas is still in development. There _will_ be breaking changes until we hit 1.0. As such, it's **not yet ready for production use**. If you need a stable React framework try Next.js or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
- Rakkas doesn't aim compatibility with Next.js. Check out [Vitext](https://github.com/Aslemammad/vitext) if you want to port a Next.js application to Vite.
- Rakkas is somewhat opinionated. If you need more flexibility try [vite-ssr-plugin](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/).
