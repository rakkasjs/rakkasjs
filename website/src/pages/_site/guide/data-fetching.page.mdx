# Data fetching

Data fetching in React applications is not trivial. There are many soltions of varying quality ranging from a simple `useEffect` hook to feature-packed libraries. Rakkas pages and layouts being plain React components, you're free to use any of those methods. However, Rakkas offers a **simple and straightforward solution** that works both during **server-side rendering as well as on the client**.

If a page or layout needs to fetch data before rendering, instead of exporting a simple React component, you can default export a page or layout definition using the `definePage` or `defineLayout` functions. They take a page/layout definition, which is an object with a `Component` prop that defines the React component. It may also have a `load` function that fetches data for your page or layout. Rakkas will call this function before rendering your component. If you return a promise, Rakkas will wait until it resolves. The `data` prop of the (resolved) return value will be passed to the component as `props.data`.

Here's a simple example of data loading that uses the free Pokéapi:

import fetchDefinePageExample from "$examples/fetch-define-page/[pokemon].page.tsx?sample";

<SampleViewer
	url="/examples/fetch-define-page/pikachu"
	code={fetchDefinePageExample}
	height="35em"
/>

`load` may run either on the server or on the client: When the page is first loaded, the page will be rendered server-side so it will be called on the server and its return value will be serialized and sent to the client. But during client-side navigation, it will be called on the client-side without hitting the server. This means that there are some rules you have to follow:

- The code in `load` must be able to run both on the server and the browser; you should not call Node-only or browser-only APIs. In particular, `window` and `document` are not available.
- The returned `data` property must be serializable using [devalue](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue). Check their documentation to see what's allowed.

> The load function is passed the following arguments:
>
> #### `url: URL`
>
> URL of the page being loaded. You can use it to access, for example, the query string with `url.search` or `url.searchParams`.
>
> ---
>
> #### `params: Record<string, string>`
>
> Path parameters for [dynamic routes](/guide/pages-and-routing#dynamic-routes).
>
> ---
>
> #### `fetch: function`
>
> A function with the same API to the browser's [`fetch` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). When `load` is called on the client, it really _is_ the browser's `fetch`. On the server, it is a special function that is designed to behave just like the client-side `fetch` as closely as possible. ⚠️ **You should only use this function for fetching data**. Using `XMLHttpRequest`, `axios`, or similar is not supported and will fail during server-side rendering. Using the global `fetch` function is also disallowed.

There are three types of possible return values:

1. **A succesful result** is an object with a `data` property that will be passed to the page component as `props.data`, and optionally a `status` property which should be an integer in the form of 2xx that will be used as the HTTP status of the response when doing server-side rendering. Default is 200.
2. **An error result** is an object with an `error` property describing the error. We'll cover error handling more in depth below. For now all you should only know is that it has to have a `message` property. The return value may also have an optional `status` property which should be an integer in the form of 4xx or 5xx that will be used as the HTTP status of the response when doing server-side rendering. Default is 500, indicating a server error. If your `load` function throws or returns a promise that rejects, it will be treated as if it returned an error 500.
3. **A redirection result** is an object that includes a `location` property which may be either a string or a URL object. A redirection result will abort the rendering of the current page and the user will be redirected to the specified location. The return value must also have a `status` property which should be an integer in the form of 3xx that will be used as the HTTP status of the redirection response when doing server-side rendering.

> If you come from Next.js, `load` is similar to `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`. But there are important differences: `getServerSideProps` will only run on the server but `load` may run either on the server or the client. So, calling backend functions from `load` is not allowed, all communication must go through an API even during server-side rendering. If you're familiar with `SvelteKit`, it is very similar to how it handles data fetching.
