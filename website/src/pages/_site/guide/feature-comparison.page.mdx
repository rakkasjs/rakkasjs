### Notes:

1. Rakkas itself doesn't have a large community, but the [Vite ecosystem](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite) is impressive and ever growing.
2. Next.js doesn't really support localization of URL paths, only language detection: i.e. it allows `/en/home` and `/fr/home`, but not `/fr/accueil`.
