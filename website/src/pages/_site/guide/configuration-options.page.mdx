# Configuration options

Rakkas looks for a configuration file named `rakkas.config.js` (or `.ts`) in your project root. This file is bundled with esbuild before loading, so you can use modern EcmaScript and TypeScript features.

The configuration file is not needed if you're happy with the defaults.

This file should default export a configuration object or a function that returns one (possibly asynchronously). Supported options are:

| Property                  | Description                                                                                                   | Default value             |

| pageExtensions            | File extensions for [pages](./pages-and-routing) and [layouts](./layouts)                                     | `["jsx", "tsx"]`          |

| trustForwardedOrigin      | Set to true to trust `x-forwarded-*` headers during development¹                                              | `false`                   |
| prerender                 | An array of paths to be pre-rendered.                                                                         | `[]` (`["/"]` for static) |
| vite <a href="#vite" />   | [Vite configuration](https://vitejs.dev/config/) (not all options are supported)                              | `{}`                      |

¹ See the `TRUST_FORWARDED_ORIGIN` [environment variable](./environment-variables) for production use.

## defineConfig

You can import the `defineConfig` function from `@rakkasjs/cli` to ensure TypeScript IDE completion.

## Conditional configuration

You can provide a function (can be async) instead of a configuration object. The function will be called with the following info:

```typescript
export interface ConfigFactoryInfo {
	/** Rakkas command that is being executed */
	command: "dev" | "build";

	/** Deployment target (only available for the "build" command) */
	deploymentTarget?:
		| "node"
		| "static"
		| "vercel"
		| "netlify"
		| "cloudflare-workers";
}
```

You can also provide a function for Vite configuration. In build mode, it will be called with an argument specifying whether the configuration will be used for `"ssr"` or `"client"`.
