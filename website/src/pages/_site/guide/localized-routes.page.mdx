# Localized routes

Suppose you want to build a bilingual site and you want to have the following routes:

| English        | French                | Description      |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `/en`          | `/fr`                 | Home             |
| `/en/about-us` | `/fr/qui-sommes-nous` | About us         |
| `/en/products` | `/fr/produits`        | List of products |

You can achieve this by defining a `extractLocale` hook in your [common customization hooks file](/guide/customization-hooks#common) like the following:

```ts
import { defineCommonHooks } from "rakkasjs";

export default defineCommonHooks({
	extractLocale(url) {
		let path = url.pathname;

		if (path === "/en" || path.startsWith("/en/")) {
			return { locale: "en", url: path.substr(3) || "/" };
		} else if (url === "/fr" || url.startsWith("/fr/")) {
			path = url.href.substr(3) || "/";
			// Rewrite the path to the "canonical" version
			switch (path) {
				case "/":
					path = "/";
					break;
				case "/qui-sommes-nous":
					path = "/about-us";
					break;
				case "/produits":
					path = "/products";
					break;
			}

			return { locale: "fr", url: path };
		} else {
			return { locale: "en" };
		}
	},
});
```

This way, you can define your pages in `pages/page.jsx`, `pages/about-us.page.jsx`, and `pages/products.page.jsx`. The extracted locale will be available in your load functions and via the `useLocale` custom hook exported from `rakkasjs`. Then you can use your favorite internationalization library to translate the page contents.

If you also want to have an international landing page at `/` which detects the visitor's locale to redirect to the corresponding page, you can set `locales.detect` to true in your configuration and change your `extractLocale` hook like this:

```ts
let path = url.pathname;

if (path === "/") {
    // Redirection for each available locale
	return { redirect: { en: "/en", fr: "/fr" } };
} else if (path === "/en" || path.startsWith("/en/")) {
// ...etc
```

Rakkas will look at the `Accept-Language` header on the server and `navigator.languages` or `navigator.language` on the client to detect the locale and redirect accordingly. If you set the `locales.cookieName` configuration option to, say, `"LOCALE"`, Rakkas will look at the value of the `LOCALE` cookie first. You can use this feature to provide manual language selection functionality. You should redirect to the new locale URL (via `navigate` or `location.assign`) after setting the cookie on the client.

Such a language detection route will never be pre-rendered unless the deployment target is `static`. But Rakkas will crawl all available local versions that it can redirect to. When the deployment target _is_ `static`, Rakkas will render an HTML file that loads a small script to detect the locale and redirect on the client. If JavaScript is disabled, a simple list of links to each localized version of the page will be rendered.

You may also consider setting `locales.default` configuration option, which is `en` by default.

Rakkas will set the `Content-Language` header and the `lang` attribute of the `<html>` tag correctly but it can't render `hreflang` links by itself.

The `extractLocale` hook is very flexible, you can use domain, subdomain, path, or query parameter strategies to detect the locale. URL rewriting is optional, so you can have `/fr/about-us` and `/fr/products` if you prefer.

If client-side navigation causes the locale to change (like when you click on a `Link` to `/fr` from `/en`), all of your `load` functions will be called again and your entire application will be re-rendered.
