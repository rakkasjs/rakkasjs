# Deployment targets

Rakkas has first-class support for deploying on Node, Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Workers, as well as static file servers. The `build` CLI command accepts a `--deployment-target` option (`-d` for short) to specify the deployment target. Its value can be `node`, `static`, `vercel`, `netlify`, or `cloudflare-workers`. The default value is `node`.

## Node

When you build your application for Node, Rakkas will generate a Node application with an entry point in `dist/server/index.js`, so you can start the server with `node dist/server`. The generated server doesn't reference any external modules, so you only need to install the dependencies used in _your own_ code. In particular, `rakkasjs` and `@rakkasjs/cli` don't need to be installed

You can customize the runtime behavior of the server with the following environment variables:

| Variable                 | Description                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `TRUST_FORWARDED_ORIGIN` | Whether to trust `x-forwarded-*` headers    |
| `HOST`                   | Server host                                 |
| `PORT`                   | HTTP port                                   |
| `DISABLE_STATIC_SERVER`  | Whether to disable serving of static assets |

The server can serve the client assets on its own (using [`sirv`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv)) but if you choose to use your reverse proxy (e.g. NGINX) to serve them instead, they reside in the `dist/client` directory. In this case you may set the `DISABLE_STATIC_SERVER` environment variable to `1` to disable the static asset server which may reduce the start-up time of the server and its memory footprint.

## Static <a id="static"/>

If your entire application is [suitable for pre-rendering](./rendering-modes#pre-rendering), you can build a static site with `rakkas build -d static`. The generated site will be in the `dist` directory, so you can preview it with, e.g., `npx sirv dist`. A static site doesn't need a Node.js server, you can serve it from a CDN or a static file server like **Github pages**.

The default value for the `prerender` configuration option will be set as `["/"]` instead of `[]` and the default value for the `prerender` property of `load` function results and endpoint responses will be set to `true` when using the static deployment target. In other words, pre-rendering will be opt-out instead of opt-in. Pages and API routes that weren't pre-rendered will not be available.

Page redirections will be rendered as HTML pages with a `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=...">` tag.

## Vercel

If you add a `build` or `vercel-build` script to your `package.json` with the content `rakkas build -d vercel`, you can use the Vercel CLI or their [git integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git) to deploy your app.

Vercel can't automatically detect a Rakkas application as of yet but Rakkas uses the [file system API](https://vercel.com/docs/file-system-api), so you can just use the default values for build and development settings.

## Netlify

Create a `netlify.toml` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```toml
[build]
command = "npx rakkas build -d netlify"
publish = "netlify/static"
```

and use the Netlify CLI to deploy your app. You can also [link your git repository to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/) to automatically deploy your app when you push to your repository.

## Cloudflare Workers

Create a `wrangler.toml` file in the root of your project like the following:

```toml
compatibility_date = "2021-11-01"
compatibility_flags = []
name = "<the name of your app>"
route = ''
site = {bucket = "cloudflare/static", entry-point = "cloudflare"}
type = "javascript"
usage_model = ''
workers_dev = true
zone_id = ''

[build]
command = "npx rakkas build -d cloudflare-workers"

[build.upload]
format = "service-worker"
```

and use `wrangler` CLI tool to deploy your app. `miniflare` is also supported (use `miniflare cloudflare/index.js`)
